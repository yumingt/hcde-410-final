The goal of this research project is to investigate the relationship between education and income in the United States for the year of 2021, with a focus on understanding how this relationship varies across race and gender. By examining this connection, I aim to gain insights into the patterns and disparities in socioeconomic status, which can inform policy decisions aimed at reducing inequality.

To conduct this analysis, I will use the American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data available on the US Census Bureau website, and visualize this relationship using scatter plots, bar charts, or heat maps. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed at the following link: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html.
